# What is CORS?

CORS stands for "_Cross-Origin Resource Sharing_". In simpler terms, it's a mechanism that allows web browsers to make requests to resources on different domains.

For example, let's say you're browsing a website at _`example.com`_, and that website tries to load an image from a different domain, _`images.com`_. Without CORS, the web browser would block that request because it would be considered a security risk - [an attacker could potentially use that request to steal data from the user](#how-an-attacker-could-potentially-use-that-request-to-steal-data-from-the-user)

To allow the request to go through, images.com needs to explicitly tell the web browser that it's okay to make that request. It does this by including a special HTTP header in its response to the browser, called the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header. This header tells the browser which domains are allowed to make requests to images.com. If example.com is on the list of allowed domains, the browser will allow the request to go through and load the image.

In summary, CORS is a security mechanism that controls which domains are allowed to make requests to resources on other domains. It's an important security feature of the web, and it helps to prevent attacks that could steal sensitive user data.

## How an attacker could potentially use that request to steal data from the user?

An attacker could potentially use a cross-origin request to steal data from a user in a few ways. One common attack is called a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack. Here's an example of how a CSRF attack could work:

Let's say that the user is logged into their bank's website in one tab of their web browser, and they're also browsing a malicious website in another tab. The malicious website contains some HTML and JavaScript code that, when executed in the user's browser, sends a request to the bank's website to transfer money out of the user's account.

Normally, the bank's website wouldn't allow this request because it's coming from a different domain (the malicious website) than the one the user is logged into. However, if the bank's website doesn't properly implement CORS, it might allow the request to go through, thinking that it's coming from the user's own browser.

So, when the user visits the malicious website and the code is executed, it sends the request to the bank's website and transfers the money out of the user's account, all without the user's knowledge or consent.

This is just one example of how an attacker could use a cross-origin request to steal data or perform other malicious actions. That's why it's important to properly implement CORS to prevent these kinds of attacks.
